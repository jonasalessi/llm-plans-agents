Refactor this component with the best practices. It currently handles too many responsibilities. Split logic into reusable hooks and smaller, focused components.

Before proposing the plan:
- Use the project's search tool to check for existing hooks, components, or utilities that can be reused to avoid duplication
- Identify overlapping patterns and confirm whether shared abstractions already exist.

Deliverables:
- A brief refactor plan outlining proposed hooks, subcomponents, and their responsibilities.
- A list of any existing project modules leveraged (with paths).
- Notes on removed responsibilities from the original component and where they now live.
