description: Refactor a React component to follow best practices
argument-hint: Provide the component name or path
---

Refactor this component to align with #React Agent.agent.md best practices. It currently handles too many responsibilities. Split logic into reusable hooks and smaller, focused components.

Before proposing the plan:
- Use the project's search tool to check for existing hooks, components, or utilities that can be reused to avoid duplication
- Identify overlapping patterns and confirm whether shared abstractions already exist.

Deliverables:
- A brief refactor plan outlining proposed hooks, subcomponents, and their responsibilities.
- A list of any existing project modules leveraged (with paths).
- Notes on removed responsibilities from the original component and where they now live.
