- Date: 
- Appetite (time/people): 
- Links: [Gathering doc](), [Sketches](), [Metrics]()

## Problem

[Concise description of the problem and why it matters.]

## Outcome & Success

- Target outcomes (observable, measurable): 
- Success metrics and how we’ll track them: 

## Users

- Primary users/personas and key needs: 

## Shaped Solution (Fat-Marker)

- Core idea (one paragraph): 
- Key flows (bullets): 
- Boundaries (what’s in): 

## No-Gos (Out of Scope)

- Items explicitly excluded from this bet:
- Future considerations not included now:

## Functional Requirements

1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]

## Rules & Constraints (Just Enough)

- Validation/eligibility rules: 
- Performance/latency expectations:

## Test Scenarios (Outline)

```gherkin
Feature: <Feature name>

  Background:
    Given <preconditions>

  Scenario: Happy path
    When <user action>
    Then <expected outcome>

  Scenario: Validation error
    When <invalid input>
    Then <error message>

  Scenario: Dependency failure
    When <dependency behavior>
    Then <graceful handling>
```
