# Technical Specification Template

## Executive Summary

[Provide a concise technical view of the solution approach. Summarize the key architectural decisions and implementation strategy in 1-2 paragraphs.]

## System Architecture

### Component Overview

[Briefly describe the main components and their responsibilities:

- Component names and primary functions
- Key relationships between components
- High-level data flow]

## Implementation Design

### Key Interfaces

[Define the main service interfaces (â‰¤20 lines per example):

```ts
// Example interface definition
interface Name {
    methodName(input: InputType): OutputType
}
```

]

### Data Models

[Define the essential data structures:

- Core domain entities
- Request/response types
- Database schemas (if applicable)]

### API Endpoints

[List API endpoints if applicable:

- Method and path (e.g., `POST /api/v0/resource`)
- Brief description
- Request/response format references]

## Integration Points

[Include only if the feature requires external integrations:

- External services or APIs
- Authentication requirements
- Error handling approach]

## Impact Analysis

[Detail the potential impact of this feature on existing components, services, and data stores:]

| Affected Component         | Impact Type              | Description & Risk Level              | Required Action       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Example: `auth-service` API| API Change (Compatible)  | Adds optional `scope` field. Low risk.| Notify frontend team  |
| Example: `users` table     | Schema Change            | Adds new column. Medium risk.         | Coordinate migration  |

[Categories to consider:

- **Direct Dependencies:** Modules that will call or be called by this feature
- **Shared Resources:** DB tables, caches, queues used by multiple components
- **API Changes:** Any modifications to existing endpoints or contracts
- **Performance Impact:** Components that may experience load changes]

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests

[Describe the unit testing strategy:

- Primary components to test
- Mock requirements (external services only)
- Critical test scenarios]

### Integration Tests

[If needed, describe the integration tests:

- Components to test together
- Test data requirements
- Tests should live in the `__test__/integration/` directory]

## Development Sequencing

### Build Order

[Define the implementation sequence:

1. First component/feature (justify why first)
2. Second component/feature (dependencies)
3. Subsequent components
4. Integration and testing]

### Technical Dependencies

[List any blocking dependencies:

- Required infrastructure
- External service availability
- Deliverables from other teams]

## Monitoring and Observability

[Define the monitoring approach using existing infrastructure:

- Metrics to expose (Prometheus format)
- Key logs and log levels
- Integration with existing Grafana dashboards
- Use the `infra/monitoring` package]

## Technical Considerations

### Key Decisions

[Document important technical decisions:

- Selected approach and justification
- Trade-offs considered
- Rejected alternatives and why]

### Known Risks

[Identify technical risks:

- Potential challenges
- Mitigation approaches
- Areas requiring research]

### Special Requirements

[Only if applicable:

- Performance requirements (specific metrics)
- Security considerations (beyond standard auth)
- Additional monitoring needs]

### Standards Compliance

[Confirm adherence to project standards:

- Follows the #file:../rules/code-standards.md principles
- Implements proper error handling]
